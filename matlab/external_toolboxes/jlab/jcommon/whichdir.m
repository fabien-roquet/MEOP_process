function[dir]=whichdir(name)
%   WHICHDIR  Returns directory name containing file in search path.
%
%   WHICHDIR NAME returns the directory containing a file called NAME,
%   i.e. the full path of the file excluding NAME and the trailing '/'. 
%
%   If more than one directory contains a file called NAME, then 
%   WHICHDIR returns a cell array of directories names.
%
%   If NAME does not include an extension, then it is interpreted as
%   the name of an m-file, i.e. having extension '.m' .
