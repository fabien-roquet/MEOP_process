   ALONGTRACK is a matfile containing the sea surface height anomalies
   from the integrated alongtrack altimetry dataset, available online at

     http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/MERGED_TP_J1_OSTM_OST_CYCLES_V2

   This dataset is produced by Brian Beckley and collaborators on NASA's
   Ocean Surface Topography Science Team (OSTST).  It contains data from
   the TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, and OSTM/Jason-2 satelliets.

   ALONGTRACK.MAT is a slightly reorganized matfile version of the NetCDF 
   data distributed at PO.DAAC, and is redistributed with permission as a
   supplement to the software toolbox JLAB. 

   Various processing steps have been carried out to remove bad data 
   points, as described below.

   LOAD ALONGTRACK loads the structure ALONGTRACK, containing the 
   following fields:

     alongtrack.about  Pointer to this document                   
     alongtrack.num    Cycle start in DATENUM format    [758 x 1]
     alongtrack.dnum   Days from cycle start date       [3375 x 254]
     alongtrack.lat    Latitude                         [3375 x 254]
     alongtrack.lon    Longitude                        [3375 x 254]
     alongtrack.atd    Along-track distance (km)        [3375 x 254]
     alongtrack.mss    Mean sea surface height (cm)     [3375 x 254]
     alongtrack.ssh    Sea surface height anomaly (cm)  [3375 x 254 x 758] 
     alongtrack.grid   Fields for mapping ssh to grid   Structure 
  
   The mean sea surface height is given in the PO.DAAC documentation as 
   being the DTU10 Global Gravity field of Anderson (2010). 

   Note that sea surface height is here given in centimeters. 

   The first dimension, of length 3375, is the number of measurements
   along each track.  The second, of dimension 254, is the number of 
   tracks split into their descending and ascending portions.  The third
   dimesion, of length 758, is the number of cycles. 

   After 'load alongtrack', type 'use alongtrack' to map the structure
   fields into named variables in the workspace--num, lat, lon, ssh, etc.

   The GRID field is described below under 'Mapping with POLYSMOOTH'.

   The figure shown at the top is standard deviation of sea surface
   height, mapped onto a regular grid with POLYSMOOTH as described below.
   With JLAB installed, it can be re-created with 'about_alongtrack --f'.

   ALONGTRACK.MAT is distributed as a part of JDATA, a supplement to the 
   software toolbox JLAB, and is available at http://www.jmlilly.net.

   Time details
 
   NUM is the time at the beginning of each cycle, in Matlab's DATENUM 
   format. DNUM is the mean difference from this time, averaged over all 
   cycles, for each location along each track.  

   Deviations of the exact time differences from their mean values over
   all cycles are small, typically 5% of the mean values.   

   In order to save space, the exact times for each measurement are not 
   re-distributed here.  Instead DNUM is deduced from the exact time field
   available from PO.DAAC.
   __________________________________________________________________
   
   Organization

   The data has been re-organized somewhat from its original format.  Each
   track has been split into a descending and ascending portion. 

   All descending passes are presented first, but flipped north/south to 
   be sorted by the longitude of their southermost point, beginning with 
   the first track having a southernmost point east of longitude -180.  

   Then all ascending passes are presented, also sorted from longitude 
   -180 based on their initial or southermost point.

   This reorganization makes it easier to locate tracks that fall through
   particular latitude / longitude points.  Also, each row of SSH occurs
   at essentially the same latitude, so one can directly average the 
   alongtrack-data to get meaningful statistics across latitudes.

   The time offset from the cycle start time are therefore scrambled among
   the different tracks.  These time offsets are recorded in DNUM.

   The field ATD is the cumulative along-track distance from the initial 
   point of each track, as computed by SPHEREDIST.

   A figure illustrating the ALONGTRACK format is shown below.  This is 
   the standard deviation of sea surface height, as in the figure at the 
   top but without any mapping.  Each column is a track with ascending and
   descending tracks split.  The distorted view reflects the way the 
   satellite tracks actually sample the ocean.

   Processing

   Several processing steps have been applied to remove bad data points.  
   Firstly, all data over land has been set to NaNs, affecting a small 
   number of data points.  

   Secondly, all data at locations missing 3/4 or more of their values are
   set to NaNs.  This affects about 3% of all valid data points, and 
   primarily influences regions with seasonally varying ice cover.

   Finally, the data has been despiked, with the spikes set to NaNs.  This
   is done by looking at the statistics of the first central difference.  

   A representative standard deviation of this quantity is 4 cm.  All
   points having a first central difference with a magnitude exceeding
   three times this standard deviation, or 12 cm, are set to NaNs.  This 
   also affects about 3% of the valid data points.

   Mapping with POLYSMOOTH

   ALONGTRACK includes some pre-computed fields that are useful in mapping 
   the sea surface height to a regular grid using the POLYSMOOTH function
   that is distributed as a part of JLAB.   

   The GRID field is itself a structure containing the following fields:

     grid.lato   Latitudes for 1 x 1 degree gridding    [133 x 1]
     grid.lono   Longitudes for 1 x 1 degree gridding   [361 x 1] 
     grid.ds     Distances from data to grid point      [133 x 361 x 1701]
     grid.xs     X-location of data from grid points    [133 x 361 x 1701]
     grid.ys     Y-location of data from grid points    [133 x 361 x 1701]
     grid.index  Index into locations of sorted data    [133 x 361 x 1701]
   
   These fields characterize all latitude and longititude observations
   points that are less than a cutoff distance of 250 kilometers from each 
   point on a 1 degree x 1 degree grid, as output by SPHERESORT.

   To map the standard deviation of sea surface variance, for instance, 
   use INDEX to locate the nearest observations for each grid point

       sshstd=vstd(ssh,3);
       zs=nan*zeros(size(xs));
       zs(~isnan(index))=sshstd(index(~isnan(index)));

   and then call POLYSMOOTH with the fields DS, XS, YS, and ZS.

   The figure shown at top is generated with a first-order fit by 
   POLYSMOOTH using a variable fit radius that grabs the nearest 70 data
   points.  This is augmented very near to coastlines by blending with a 
   zeroth-order fit that grabs the nearest 100 data points.  

   See SPHERESORT and POLYSMOOTH for details.

   Dataset creation

   The NetCDF file on which ALONGTRACK.MAT is based are available for 
   download from PO.DAAC as follows 

       ftp  ftp://podaac-ftp.jpl.nasa.gov
       cd   allData/merged_alt/preview/L2/TP_J1_OSTM/all
       get  Merged_TOPEX_Jason_OSTM_Version_V2.3.nc.gz
  
   For completeness, the m-file ALONGTRACK also contains the processing 
   steps used in the creation of the corresponding matfile.  This 
   requires that the current version of JLAB is on your search path.

   Then 'alongtrack --create' will recreate ALONGTRACK.MAT by reading in
   the NetCDF file as downloaded from PO.DAAC. This will take a while.

   You'll need to make sure to put the directory containing the file on
   your Matlab search path using ADDPATH, e.g. 'addpath ~/Data/beckley'.
