   JLAB_HIGHLIGHTS  Highlights from the JLAB toolbox.

   TWODSTATS, TWODMED, TWODHIST.  Examining temperature mean and standard
   deviation over a lat/lon grid, or current speed as a function of say
   temperature and salinity, or any analysis of multivariate datasets, is
   faster and easier than you ever imagined.  If you are working with 
   data and not using these routines, you should seriously take five 
   minutes right now and try them out.  I wrote fast, exact, and loopless
   algorithms that are often 100 times (!) faster than the obvious way.  

   MSPEC.  If you analyze time series, you need a method you can rely on.
   There are many compelling reasons to prefer the &quot;multitaper&quot; method.
   In this method, a set of estimates from optimally concentrated tapers
   or window functions are averaged together, reducing variance while 
   minimizing bias.  MSPEC makes using the multitaper straightforward.  
   Just call SLEPTAP first to generate the tapers.  MSPEC features support
   for cross spectra and rotary spectra, as well as 'adaptive' estimation.
   
   WAVETRANS.  A lot of work and original research has gone into this 
   continuous wavelet transform routine, which I believe is the best you 
   will find anywhere, and it's free.  Features natural integration with
   the generalized Morse wavelets (see below), choice of conditions at 
   the signal endpoints, support for multiple wavelets or mulit-component
   data, and convenient handling of real-valued or complex-valued data.

   MORSEWAVE.  A detailed analysis of types of continuous wavelets 
   (Lilly and Olhede, 2009) points to a super-family, the generalized 
   Morse wavelets, that should answer your questions about which wavelet
   to employ. Pick the generalized Morse wavelet with parameter gamma=3 
   unless you have a very good reason to do otherwise.  This wavelet is
   'like' the Morlet in spirit, but without the Morlet's serious flaws at
   narrow time-domain settings---which is when you most want to employ a 
   wavelet anyway.  Use MORSESPACE to easily determine frequency bins.

   RIDGEWALK.  If your time series data contains signals that oscillate
   but also change in time, the wavelet transform can be used as the basis
   for a remarkably powerful analysis that connects time-varying 
   properties to spectral structure.  The starting place for this analysis
   is RIDGEWALK.  This advanced algorithm incorporates original research 
   from Lilly &amp; Olhede (2010a+b, 2011).  A key innovation is the ability 
   to view *multivariate* and univariate time series within the same 
   framework as modulated oscillations.

   POLYSMOOTH.  Need to map scattered data, for example, temperature as a 
   function of X and Y?  POLYSMOOTH, short for &quot;Polynomial Smoothing&quot;, 
   is a powerful and quite general mapping algorithm.  Features choice of 
   order of the fit, choice of local weighting function, support for 
   spherical geometry, options for constant fit radius or constant number
   of data points with variable radius.  This algorithm was implemented
   for the forthcoming Aquarius Sea Surface Salinity satellite.

   JGRAPH.  Finessing figures in Matlab can be a total hassle.  Which
   would you prefer to type, version (a) or  version (b) ? 

      (a)  z=peaks;
           plot(z(:,1),'linewidth',3,'linestyle','-','color','b'),hold on
           plot(z(:,2),'linewidth',2,'linestyle','--','color','r')

      (b)  z=peaks;plot(z(:,1:2)), linestyle 3b- 2r--

   They are identical.  JLAB's LINESTYLE will save you a lot of time.  
   It includes natural syntax for grayscale, as in &quot;linestyle 3k- 2G-.&quot;,
   where the letter G stands for the shade of gray, between A and K. 
   The JGRAPH module contains many similar time-saving functions, such as
   YLOG and YLIN, YOFFSET, FLIPY, OUTTICKS, FLIPMAP, etc.

   PACKFIG.  Are your multiple subplots too far away from each other?  
   Don't like having to set the axes properties by hand each time?  Try  
   this function.  For example, &quot;packfig(3,4)&quot; will squish your 3 rows and 
   4 columns so they are right next to each other, removing the redundant
   x- and y-axes labels.
