% USAGE:
%  SonCl = gsw_SonCl
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%  The ratio of Practical Salinity, SP, to Chlorinity, 1.80655 kg/g for
%  Reference Seawater (Millero et al., 2008).  This is the ratio that was 
%  used by the JPOTS committee in their construction of the 1978 Practical
%  Salinity Scale (PSS-78) to convert between the laboratory measurements 
%  of seawater samples (which were measured in Chlorinity) to Practical 
%  Salinity.  
%
% OUTPUT:
%  SonCl  =  SP to Chlorinity ratio                           [ (g/kg)^-1 ]
