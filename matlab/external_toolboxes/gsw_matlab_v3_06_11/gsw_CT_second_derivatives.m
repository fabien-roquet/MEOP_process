% USAGE:
%  [CT_SA_SA, CT_SA_pt, CT_pt_pt] = gsw_CT_second_derivatives(SA,pt)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%  Calculates the following three, second-order derivatives of Conservative 
%  Temperature
%   (1) CT_SA_SA, the second derivative with respect to Absolute Salinity  
%       at constant potential temperature (with p_ref = 0 dbar),
%   (2) CT_SA_pt, the derivative with respect to potential temperature
%       (the regular potential temperature which is referenced to 0 dbar)
%       and Absolute Salinity, and
%   (3) CT_pt_pt, the second derivative with respect to potential 
%       temperature (the regular potential temperature which is referenced 
%       to 0 dbar) at constant Absolute Salinity. 
%
% INPUT:
%  SA  =  Absolute Salinity                                        [ g/kg ]
%  pt  =  potential temperature (ITS-90)                          [ deg C ]   
%         (whose reference pressure is 0 dbar)
%
%  SA & pt need to have the same dimensions.
%
% OUTPUT:
%  CT_SA_SA  =  The second derivative of Conservative Temperature with 
%               respect to Absolute Salinity at constant potential 
%               temperature (the regular potential temperature which 
%               has reference sea pressure of 0 dbar).  
%               CT_SA_SA has units of:                     [ K/((g/kg)^2) ]
%  CT_SA_pt  =  The derivative of Conservative Temperature with 
%               respect to potential temperature (the regular one with 
%               p_ref = 0 dbar) and Absolute Salinity.   
%               CT_SA_pt has units of:                        [ 1/(g/kg) ]
%  CT_pt_pt  =  The second derivative of Conservative Temperature with 
%               respect to potential temperature (the regular one with 
%               p_ref = 0 dbar) at constant SA.   
%               CT_pt_pt has units of:                              [ 1/K ]
